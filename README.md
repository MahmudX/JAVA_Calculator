# Simple Java Calculator

## My first complete Java project.

I'm not very familiar with Java but I had to create this project to complete my class assignment. Totally hated it. LOL

## Functionalaties

This calculator can perform only one operation at a time. Since it's a starter app, it can only perform addition, division, subtraction, multiplication, and modulation. I don't have any plan to update this app in future, but let's see what happens.
